## By building your own personal website

These days, pretty much every person you meet is googleable. For most of them, you'll even find a personal website that tells you about that person, acts as an online portfolio, marks their accomplishments and even provides a way to contact them. This digital portfolio has become a professional "must have". Even the Minions have a portfolio!

### Let's Get Started

In order to access this directory, select the `Open In Nitrous` button at the top of Learn.co

#### File Structure 
You should see a lot of different files and directories in this project. This is the code that makes up the Minion's personal website. 

+ `index.html` - This file stores all the HTML and content for their site

+ `css` - This directory stores several files that make up the styling for the Minions page. You're not going to want to edit any of them except for `my_css.css`

+ `font-awesome-4.1.0` - This directory contains the fonts used on the page, some styling on those fonts. Do not edit any files in this directory. 

+ `fonts` - This directory contains a bunch of glyphicons used in the site. Don't edit anything in this directory. 

+ `img` - This directory contains all the images used on the page. Any images you want to display on your website should be saved here

+ `less` - This directory contains more fancy styling. Don't edit the contents of the directory.


##### Step 1:

View this website by entering in the Nitrous terminal, `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`. 

Once you have the server running, select `preview` and then `port 3000`.

Voila, the Minion's site!

#### Step 2: HTML

Now it's time to start messing around with the text. You'll be coding your changes in `index.html`.

As you look through the code in `index.html` you'll see a series of comments like this:

```html
<!-- -------EDIT ME! #1 Replace your nav titles here------ -->
```

These comments mark sections where you can change the text of the page. Remember how we changed the text of a tweet? You can use the Chrome Developer Tools to find where in the code specific text is located to then change the text in `index.html`.

#### Step 3: CSS 

You'll want to leave all the ID's and classes that are predefined on the page the same. Those are used in the styling that's already provided for you.

If you want to start adding your own styling, like changing background or font colors, you can write your own CSS in `css/my_style.css`. You will want to define your own ids and classes in the HTML and then use those in your css.

#### Step 4: Share Share Share!

Once you're done, it's time to market your site. Screen shot your site or your code and share with **\#flatironcodeclub** and **\#ibuiltthis**.
